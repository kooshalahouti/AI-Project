# 🧠 AI Project – Naïve Bayes Text Classification

This project implements a text classification pipeline using the **Naïve Bayes** algorithm. It includes preprocessing, training on labeled data, and predicting labels for unseen test data. Designed with reproducibility and clarity in mind, this repository serves as a foundational machine learning project for text-based classification tasks.

## 🧠 Project Description

- Implements a **Naïve Bayes** text classification pipeline.
- Performs **data preprocessing**, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and test prediction.
- Final results are stored in `train_result.csv`.
- Fully documented in `Doc.pdf` and traced via Jupyter notebook `final_train.ipynb` :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- Prepares raw text data through preprocessing (tokenization, normalization).
- Trains on labeled data and evaluates model performance.
- Outputs final predictions in CSV format for test samples.
